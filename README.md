# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository contains the Python code to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CIFAR-10-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CIFAR-10-Classification
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded by Keras when you import it. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10,000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1,000 randomly selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another.

## Usage

1. Open and run the `CIFAR10_Image_Classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CIFAR10_Image_Classification.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `CIFAR10.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and testing the CNN model.
- `cifar10_model.h5`: Pre-trained CNN model for CIFAR-10 classification.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies for the project.

## Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this project has the following architecture:

- Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters (3x3)
- Convolutional Layer 2: 32 filters (3x3)
- Max Pooling Layer 1: 2x2 pool size
- Convolutional Layer 3: 64 filters (3x3)
- Convolutional Layer 4: 64 filters (3x3)
- Max Pooling Layer 2: 2x2 pool size
- Flattening Layer
- Fully Connected Layer 1: 64 nodes
- Output Layer: 10 nodes (number of classes)

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set after 10 epochs of training.
